This repository contains all my code from my learning journey in data structures and algorithms.

What I have learned (as of today):
1. The two types of data structure (linear and non-linear), their differences;
2. Application of each data structures
3. It is essential to find the appropriate data structure for each specified problem
4. Non-linear data structures are better in handling huge amount of complex data
5. Integrating Linked List and STL with Stacks.
